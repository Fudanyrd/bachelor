  abstract={This paper describes GenProg, an automated method for repairing defects in off-the-shelf, legacy programs without formal specifications, program annotations, or special coding practices. GenProg uses an extended form of genetic programming to evolve a program variant that retains required functionality but is not susceptible to a given defect, using existing test suites to encode both the defect and required functionality. Structural differencing algorithms and delta debugging reduce the difference between this variant and the original program to a minimal repair. We describe the algorithm and report experimental results of its success on 16 programs totaling 1.25 M lines of C code and 120K lines of module code, spanning eight classes of defects, in 357 seconds, on average. We analyze the generated repairs qualitatively and quantitatively to demonstrate that the process efficiently produces evolved programs that repair the defect, are not fragile input memorizations, and do not lead to serious degradation in functionality.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for automating software vulnerability detection and repair, but ensuring their correctness remains a challenge. While recent work has developed benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in bug detection and repair, existing studies rely on hand-crafted datasets that quickly become outdated. Moreover, systematic evaluation of advanced reasoning-based LLMs using chain-of-thought prompting for software security is lacking.   We introduce SecureMind, an open-source framework for evaluating LLMs in vulnerability detection and repair, focusing on memory-related vulnerabilities. SecureMind provides a user-friendly Python interface for defining test plans, which automates data retrieval, preparation, and benchmarking across a wide range of metrics.   Using SecureMind, we assess 10 representative LLMs, including 7 state-of-the-art reasoning models, on 16K test samples spanning 8 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types related to memory safety violations. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in handling memory-related vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {Fault Localization (FL) aims to automatically localize buggy lines of code, a key first step in many manual and automatic debugging tasks. Previous FL techniques assume the provision of input tests, and often require extensive program analysis, program instrumentation, or data preprocessing. Prior work on deep learning for APR struggles to learn from small datasets and produces limited results on real-world programs. Inspired by the ability of large language models (LLMs) of code to adapt to new tasks based on very few examples, we investigate the applicability of LLMs to line level fault localization. Specifically, we propose to overcome the left-to-right nature of LLMs by fine-tuning a small set of bidirectional adapter layers on top of the representations learned by LLMs to produce LLMAO, the first language model based fault localization approach that locates buggy lines of code without any test coverage information. We fine-tune LLMs with 350 million, 6 billion, and 16 billion parameters on small, manually curated corpora of buggy programs such as the Defects4J corpus. We observe that our technique achieves substantially more confidence in fault localization when built on the larger models, with bug localization performance scaling consistently with the LLM size. Our empirical evaluation shows that LLMAO improves the Top-1 results over the state-of-the-art machine learning fault localization (MLFL) baselines by 2.3\%--54.4\%, and Top-5 results by 14.4\%-35.6\%. LLMAO is also the first FL technique trained using a language model architecture that can detect security vulnerabilities down to the code line level.},

abstract={This research addresses the complex challenge of automated repair of code vulnerabilities, vital for enhancing digital security in an increasingly technology-driven world. The study introduces a novel and efficient format for the representation of code modification, using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Code Llama and Mistral. These models, fine-tuned on datasets featuring C/C++ code vulnerabilities, significantly improve the accuracy and adaptability of automated code repair techniques. A key finding is the enhanced repair accuracy of these models when compared to previous methods such as VulRepair, which underscores their practical utility and efficiency. The research also offers a critical assessment of current evaluation metrics, such as “Perfect Predictions”, and their limitations in reflecting the true capabilities of automated repair models in real-world scenarios. Following this, it underscores the importance of using test datasets devoid of train samples, emphasizing the need for dataset integrity to enhance the effectiveness of LLMs in code repair tasks. The significance of this work is its contribution to digital security, setting new standards for automated code vulnerability repair and paving the way for future advancements in the fields of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The study does not only highlight the potential of LLMs in enhancing code security but also fosters further exploration and research in these crucial areas.},

 abstract = {The advances of deep learning (DL) have paved the way for automatic software vulnerability repair approaches, which effectively learn the mapping from the vulnerable code to the fixed code. Nevertheless, existing DL-based vulnerability repair methods face notable limitations: 1) they struggle to handle lengthy vulnerable code, 2) they treat code as natural language texts, neglecting its inherent structure, and 3) they do not tap into the valuable expert knowledge present in the expert system.
To address this, we propose VulMaster, a Transformer-based neural network model that excels at generating vulnerability repairs through data-centric innovation. Specifically, VulMaster introduces the utilization and combination of various types of input data, including complete vulnerable code of any size, vulnerable code structures, and expert knowledge from the CWE system. Additionally, VulMaster leverages the collaboration between two Large Language Models (LLMs), CodeT5 and ChatGPT: CodeT5 acts as the customizable backbone LLM, fine-tuned with the training data, while ChatGPT supplements by providing missing relevant inputs to CodeT5. We evaluated VulMaster on a real-world C/C++ vulnerability repair dataset comprising 1,754 projects with 5,800 vulnerable functions. The experimental results demonstrated that VulMaster exhibits substantial improvements compared to the learning-based state-of-the-art vulnerability repair approach. Specifically, VulMaster improves the EM, BLEU, and CodeBLEU scores from 10.2\% to 20.0\%, 21.3\% to 29.3\%, and 32.5\% to 40.9\%, respectively.},
